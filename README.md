# ðŸš— Fastest Path Routing System

## Overview

This project implements a high-performance routing system that finds the **fastest path (least time)** between any two points on a map. Unlike standard algorithms that work from node to node, this system supports arbitrary **source and destination coordinates**, allowing users to **walk** to and from nearby intersections within a specified range.

## Features

- Source and destination points can be **any coordinates**, not just graph nodes.
- Walking allowed within a **radius R** (in meters) from source/destination to nearest intersection.
- Road network modeled with **nodes and edges**, each edge has a **length** and **speed**.
- Output includes:
  - Path nodes from source to destination.
  - Total travel time (minutes).
  - Distance walked and distance driven.
  - Execution time (logic only and with I/O).
- Optimized for **large graphs**:
  - Up to **200,000 nodes**
  - Up to **250,000 edges**
  - Up to **1,000 queries**

<source_x> <source_y> <destination_x> <destination_y> <max_walking_distance_in_meters>
...
ðŸ’¡ Algorithms Used
Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm (optimized with a priority queue) for shortest-time path.

Euclidean distance calculation for identifying reachable nodes within walking distance.

Performance monitoring using C#â€™s Stopwatch for execution time.

Edit
The path nodes: 0, 3, 4, 5, 2
Shortest time = 4.63 mins
Path length = 1.72 km
Walking distance = 0.28 km
Vehicle distance = 1.44 km
Execution time (no I/O) = 1 ms
Execution time (with I/O) = 5 ms
